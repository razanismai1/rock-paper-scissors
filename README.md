# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript. The player competes against the computer to reach 5 points first. This project was created as part of my journey to learn JavaScript. The first version can only be played on the console.

## Features

- Player vs. computer gameplay.
- Input validation to ensure the player chooses a valid option.
- Displays the scores of both the player and the computer after each round.
- The game ends when either the player or the computer reaches 5 points.

## How to Play

1. When prompted, enter one of the following options:
   - `1` for "rock"
   - `2` for "paper"
   - `3` for "scissors"
2. The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
3. The result will be displayed, and the score will be updated.
4. The game continues until either the player or the computer reaches 5 points.
